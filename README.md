# Study Space

## Inspiration

Due to the pandemic and decreased face-to-face interactions, students, like ourselves, faced difficulties in meeting other students. So, we focused on developing a website exclusively for forming study groups and assisting students in being more productive.

## What it does

By uploading their to-do list, or using their Google calendar students would be able to chat with other students taking similar subjects. Then, they would be able to form study groups online or even offline!

## How we built it

We used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to build this web app and integrated Google calendar.

## Challenges we ran into

It was difficult to coordinate the project as we are all in different time zones, so we do have more features we would like to add.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We manage to make the functionalities of the app work within a short period of time.

## What we learned

We learnt how to integrate chat functions into a webapp.
